            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions, education is
                compulsory up to a certain age.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.[2]


                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. </p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education designed to support early development in preparation for
                participation in school and society. The programmes are designed for children below the age of 3. This
                is ISCED level 01.[17] Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on
                the country when children enter primary education. The children now readily interact with their peers
                and the educator.[17] These are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the US,
                where the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of primary education.[19] Kindergarten
                "provides a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at
                unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them.
